### Hi there 👋
I am an architectural design researcher with the superpower of programming. Here is a bit about me, my most popular projects, and how to get in touch with you.

### About me
- 🦗 Junior computational designer. I have 4 years of experience developing plugins for [Grasshopper 3D](https://www.grasshopper3d.com/) (3d procedural modeling plugin for Rhinoceros 3D) and using code to solve architecture professional projects. 
- 🏢 My main industry is Architecture, being a plugin developer for [Revit](https://www.autodesk.com/products/revit/overview), [Rhinoceros 3D](https://www.rhino3d.com/) and so on.
- 🏛️ I want to focus on the data exchange problems in the whole process of the construction specialty, such as [IFC](https://github.com/buildingSMART/IFC4.3.x-development).
- 💖 I love complex things. I'm fascinated by procedural geometry, digital data design, and many other fields of knowledge and creativity.
